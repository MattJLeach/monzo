# My notes on the test

## My priorities

My first priority was doing anything that would help my workflow. This meant fixing a slight bug in the webpack config which was stopping the app from reloading on saving a file. Fixing this issue let me code faster as I wasn't having to reload manually. I then updated any packages and setup eslint to help find typing errors as I went.

My second priority was to add some simple styling so it was easier to visually see how everything went together on the screen. For time sake I kept this very simple.

From there, I focused on the features in the minimum requirements section before spending any remaining time on other features on the list.

## Features not implemented due to time

Below are featured that I didn't have time to implement. I have added additional comments to some of them.

__Make sure all functionality is covered by an E2E test and those tests pass__

I made sure all the exisitng tests passed but didn't have time to complete the pending test or create any more for added functionality like the editing feature.

__Convert the components into re-usable components__

Although I didn't convert any existing components into re-usable components, I did create some from scratch using named exports for UI components like the image component, etc

__Make the app more performant__

__Add type safety to the application e.g. Flow / Typescript__

__Web accessibility best practices__

__Appropriate metadata for each route e.g. page title, page metadata__
